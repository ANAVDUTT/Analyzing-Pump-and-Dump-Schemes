# Analyzing-Pump-and-Dump-Schemes
Th is project looks at stocks that have been pumped and
dumped in India, and with the use of a human in the loop
model, looked at what ratios of prominence and width could be
used to classify a pump and dum p scheme. The model we used
allowed us to find specific peaks and valleys and where they
began, their half width and prominence. By taking these factors
into account, we were able to use the sliding window to look at
specific peaks and valleys to analyze which could be classified
as a pump and dump.
